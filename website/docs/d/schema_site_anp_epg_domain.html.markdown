# mso_schema_site_anp_epg_domain #

Data source for MSO Schema Site Application Network Profiles Endpoint Groups Domain.

## Example Usage ##

### domain_name used in association with domain_type and vmm_domain_type ###

```hcl

data "mso_schema_site_anp_epg_domain" "anpEpgDomain" {
  schema_id       = data.mso_schema.schema1.id
  site_id         = data.mso_site.site1.id
  template_name   = "Template1"
  anp_name        = "ANP"
  epg_name        = "Web"
  domain_name     = "VMware-ab"
  domain_type     = "vmmDomain"
  vmm_domain_type = "VMware"
}

```

### domain_dn usage ###

```hcl
resource "mso_schema_site_anp_epg_domain" "site_anp_epg_domain" {
  schema_id = "5c4d9fca270000a101f8094a"
  template_name = "Template1"
  site_id = "5c7c95b25100008f01c1ee3c"
  anp_name = "ANP"
  epg_name = "Web"
  domain_dn = "uni/vmmp-VMware/dom-VMware-ab"
  
}

```
