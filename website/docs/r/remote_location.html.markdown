  Manages MSO Remote Location

# mso_user #

Manages MSO Remote Location.

The default behaviour of the `mso_remote_location` resource stores no sensitive attributes `password`, `ssh_key`, and `passphrase` into the statefile. A change is always detected for the sensitive attributes provided during the plan execution when `store_in_statefile` is not explicitly set to `true`.

## Example Usage ##

```hcl

# remote location with password authentication
resource "mso_remote_location" "password" {
  name        = "remote_location_password"
  description = "remote location with password authentication"
  protocol    = "scp"
  hostname    = "10.0.0.1"
  path        = "/tmp"
  username    = "admin"
  password    = "password"
}

# remote location with ssh key authentication
resource "mso_remote_location" "ssh" {
  name        = "remote_location_ssh"
  description = "remote location with ssh key authentication"
  protocol    = "scp"
  hostname    = "10.0.0.1"
  path        = "/tmp"
  username    = "admin"
  ssh_key     = "ssh_key"
  passphrase  = "passphrase"
}

# remote location with password authentication that stores sensitive attributes to statefile
resource "mso_remote_location" "password" {
  name               = "remote_location_password"
  description        = "remote location with password authentication"
  protocol           = "scp"
  hostname           = "10.0.0.1"
  path               = "/tmp"
  username           = "admin"
  password           = "password"
  store_in_statefile = true
}

```
