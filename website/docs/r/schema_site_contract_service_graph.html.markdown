# mso_schema_site_contract_service_graph #

Manages MSO Site Template Contract Service Graph.

## Example Usage ##

```hcl

resource "mso_schema_site_contract_service_graph" "example" {
  schema_id          = mso_schema.schema.id
  template_name      = "Template1"
  contract_name      = "C1"
  service_graph_name = "SG1"
  site_id            = mso_site.id
  node_relationship {
    provider_connector_cluster_interface      = "example_provider_cluster_interface"
    provider_connector_redirect_policy_tenant = "example_tenant"
    provider_connector_redirect_policy        = "example_redirect_policy"
    consumer_connector_cluster_interface      = "example_consumer_cluster_interface"
    consumer_connector_redirect_policy_tenant = "example_tenant"
    consumer_connector_redirect_policy        = "example_redirect_policy"
    consumer_subnet_ips                       = ["1.1.1.1/24", "2.2.2.2/24"]
  }
  node_relationship {
    provider_connector_cluster_interface = "example_provider_cluster_interface"
    consumer_connector_cluster_interface = "example_consumer_cluster_interface"
  }
}

# Cloud Network Controller site configuration
resource "mso_schema_site_contract_service_graph" "example" {
  schema_id          = mso_schema.schema.id
  template_name      = "Template1"
  contract_name      = "C1"
  service_graph_name = "SG1"
  site_id            = mso_site.id
}
