# mso_schema_site_anp_epg_domain #

Manages MSO Schema Site Application Network Profiles Endpoint Groups Domain.

## Example Usage ##

### domain_name used in association with domain_type and vmm_domain_type ###

```hcl

resource "mso_schema_site_anp_epg_domain" "site_anp_epg_domain" {
  schema_id                = mso_schema.schema1.id
  template_name            = "Template1"
  site_id                  = mso_schema_site.schema_site.site_id
  anp_name                 = mso_schema_site_anp_epg.site_anp_epg.anp_name
  epg_name                 = mso_schema_site_anp_epg.site_anp_epg.epg_name
  domain_type              = "vmmDomain"
  vmm_domain_type          = "VMware"
  domain_name              = "VMware-ab"
  deploy_immediacy         = "lazy"
  resolution_immediacy     = "lazy"
  vlan_encap_mode          = "static"
  allow_micro_segmentation = true
  switching_mode           = "native"
  switch_type              = "default"
  micro_seg_vlan_type      = "vlan"
  micro_seg_vlan           = 46
  port_encap_vlan_type     = "vlan"
  port_encap_vlan          = 45
  enhanced_lag_policy_name = "Lacp"
  enhanced_lag_policy_dn   = "uni/vmmp-VMware/dom-VMware-ab/vswitchpolcont/enlacplagp-Lacp"
}

```

### domain_dn usage ###

```hcl

  anp_name = "ANP"
  epg_name = "Web"
  domain_dn = "uni/vmmp-VMware/dom-VMware-ab"

  resolution_immediacy = "lazy"
  vlan_encap_mode = "static"
  allow_micro_segmentation = true
  switching_mode = "native"
  switch_type = "default"
  micro_seg_vlan_type = "vlan"
  micro_seg_vlan = 46
  port_encap_vlan_type = "vlan"
  port_encap_vlan = 45
  enhanced_lag_policy_name = "Lacp"
  enhanced_lag_policy_dn = "uni/vmmp-VMware/dom-VMware-ab/vswitchpolcont/enlacplagp-Lacp"

}

```

## Argument Reference ##

* `anp_name` - (Required) Name of Application Network Profiles.
* `epg_name` - (Required) Name of Endpoint Group to manage.
* `dn` - (Optional) **Deprecated**. The domain profile name. Use `domain_dn` or `domain_name` in association with `domain_type` and `vmm_domain_type` when it is applicable instead.
* `domain_dn` - (Optional) The dn of domain. This is required when `domain_name` and `domain_type` are not specified.
* `domain_name` - (Optional) The domain profile name. This is required when `domain_dn` is not used. This attribute requires `domain_type` and `vmm_domain_type` (when it is applicable) to be set.
* `domain_type` - (Optional) The type of domain to associate. This is required when `domain_dn` is not used. Choices: [ vmmDomain, l3ExtDomain, l2ExtDomain, physicalDomain, fibreChannelDomain ]

* `deploy_immediacy` - (Required) The deployment immediacy of the domain. Choices: [ immediate, lazy ]
* `resolution_immediacy` - (Required) Determines when the policies should be resolved and available. Choices: [ immediate, lazy, pre-provision ]
* `vlan_encap_mode` - (Optional) Which VLAN encap mode to use. This attribute can only be used with vmmDomain domain association. Choices: [ static, dynamic ]
* `allow_micro_segmentation` - (Optional) Specifies microsegmentation is enabled or not. This attribute can only be used with vmmDomain domain association.
* `switching_mode` - (Optional) Which switching mode to use with this domain association. This attribute can only be used with vmmDomain domain association.
* `switch_type` - (Optional) Which switch type to use with this domain association. This attribute can only be used with vmmDomain domain association.
