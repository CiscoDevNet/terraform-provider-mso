  filter_type   = "bothWay"
  scope         = "context"
  target_dscp   = "af11"
  filter_relationship {
    filter_schema_id     = mso_schema_template_filter_entry.filter_entry.schema_id
    filter_template_name = "Template1"
    filter_name          = mso_schema_template_filter_entry.filter_entry.name
