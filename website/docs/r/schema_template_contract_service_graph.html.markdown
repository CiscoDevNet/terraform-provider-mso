resource "mso_schema_template_contract_service_graph" "example" {
  schema_id          = mso_schema.schema1.id
  template_name      = "Template1"
  contract_name      = "C1"
  service_graph_name = "SG1"
  node_relationship {
    consumer_connector_bd_name          = "BD1"
    provider_connector_bd_schema_id     = mso_schema.schema2.id
    provider_connector_bd_template_name = "Template2"
    provider_connector_bd_name          = "BD2"
  }
  node_relationship {
    consumer_connector_bd_name = "BD1"
    provider_connector_bd_name = "BD2"
  }
  node_relationship {
    consumer_connector_bd_name = "BD1"
    provider_connector_bd_name = "BD2"
